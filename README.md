# JPEGView-Static Absolute Image Viewer for Windows

![JPEGView-Static icon](favicon_large.png?raw=true)

> Updated Nov 01 2025. Version 1.4.0.0 has been released.

**[Download MSI Windows installer](https://filedn.com/llBp1EbMQML0Hdv9A9SVo6b/JPEGView-Static/MSI/Installer_JPEGView-Static_v1.4.0.0.msi) of the latest stable release right now!**

I plan to add a video-frame capture from any movie with precise timecode accuracy utilizing FFMPEG libraries.

I plan to add a lightweight local-running AI image super-resolution feature to one of the text releases.

## The concept

This is a fork of [Sylikc's JpegView](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview) that eliminates all legacy garbage,
but gives the outstanding support of all modern 64-bit Windows systems starting from Windows 10 (and unofficially from Windows 7).

## Supported image formats

**JPEGView-Static supports nearly ALL image file formats, including too old and too new ones, so it is called the Absolute Image Viewer for Windows.**

Create an issue to support a format that is still not supported - that is a quest!

**ICC color profiles are supported, so your images will be shown in accurate colors.**
